**INTEGRITY AUDITING BASED ON THE KEYWORD WITH SENSITIVE INFORMATION PRIVACY FOR ENCRYPTED CLOUD DATA**

The public cloud data integrity auditing technique is used to check the
integrity of cloud data through the Third Party Auditor (TPA). In order to make it
more practical, we propose a new paradigm called integrity auditing based on the
keyword with sensitive information privacy for encrypted cloud data. This paradigm
is designed for one of the most common scenario, that is, the user concerns the
integrity of a portion of encrypted cloud files that contain his/her interested
keywords. 

In our proposed scheme, the TPA who is only provided with the
encrypted keyword, can audit the integrity of all encrypted cloud files that contain
the userâ€™s interested keyword. Meanwhile, the TPA cannot deduce the sensitive
information about which files contain the keyword and how many files contain this
keyword. 

These salient features are realized by leveraging a newly proposed
Relation Authentication Label (RAL). The RAL can not only authenticate the
relation that files contain the queried keyword, but also be used to generate the
auditing proof without sensitive information exposure. We give concrete security
analysis showing that the proposed scheme satisfies correctness, auditing soundness
and sensitive information privacy. We also conduct the detailed experiments to show
the efficiency of our scheme.
